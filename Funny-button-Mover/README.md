# 🏃‍♂️ Runaway Submit Button - Angular Project
![Uploading image.png…]()

A fun little Angular project where the **Submit** button literally **runs away** until the user types something in the input field. Because why not make UI playful? 😄

---

## 🧩 Features

- 🌀 Submit button randomly dodges your mouse when input is empty.
- 🧘‍♂️ The moment you type something, it calms down and lets you click it.
- 😎 Styled with smooth transitions and custom CSS.
- 🔥 Built with Angular 19 using `ngModel` and dynamic inline styles.
